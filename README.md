### E-Commerce App

An e-commerce app that provides a seamless shopping experience for users. This app integrates Firebase for product storage and database management, ensuring efficient and reliable data handling. Additionally, it leverages ShoreBird to administer automatic updates to users who have installed the app.

## Features

- E-Commerce Functionality: Browse and purchase products with ease.
- Firebase Integration: Used for storage and database management to read and store products.
- ShoreBird Integration: Ensures automatic updates are delivered to all users, reducing the need for frequent manual updates.

## What is ShoreBird?

ShoreBird is a tool for managing over-the-air (OTA) updates in Flutter applications. It allows developers to push updates directly to users without requiring them to download a new version from app stores. This ensures faster bug fixes and feature rollouts, improving the overall user experience.
